Shroom Agent's Universal:tm: Modpack Installation Guide
1) Download the latest version of the modpack
2) Download & install the required version of forge.

Windows instructions: 
	3) Navigate to your .minecraft folder in AppData (mine looks like `C:\Users\sweetie\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`)
		A) An easy way to get to this is typing `%appdata%` in your file explorer address bar, then clicking `.minecraft`
	4) Enter the `modpacks` folder (create it if it doesn't exist)
	5) Make a new folder (it can be named anything you want, but it should be able to identify the modpack. Don't use spaces)
	6) Extract the contents of the .7z file you downloaded earlier here.
		A) So if you made the folder called "SweetiesModpack", files should look like the following
			a) `.minecraft\modpacks\SweetiesModpack\config`
			b) `.minecraft\modpacks\SweetiesModpack\mods`
			c) `.minecraft\modpacks\SweetiesModpack\scripts` (not every modpack will have a scripts folder!)
	7) Create a new Minecraft profile in the launcher, and give it the following settings
		A) Name it something familiar
		B) Version should be set to the forge version you just installed (make sure the numbers at the very end match!)
		C) Game directory should be set to the same folder you made in step 5!
			a) Using the example above, mine would look like this: `C:\Users\sweetie\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\modpacks\SweetiesModpack`
		D) Click the "More Options" button underneath the resolution
		E) You can change the Java executable if you want to, but it's not required. If you don't know how this works, then you can safely leave it alone.
		F) Change the "-Xmx2G" to at **LEAST "-Xmx6G" FOR ALL MODPACKS.** You can go higher if you have the RAM/Memory to spare.
			a) This is changing the amount of RAM that Minecraft can use. My modpacks requires at minimum 6 gigabytes of RAM, but 8 gigabytes is recommended. You can go higher if you want, and if you have the available RAM.
		G) Hit save!
	8) Launch the game!
	
	
GNU/Linux instructions:

		D) Click the "More Options" button underneath the resolution
		E) Make sure your system is using **Java 8** when running modpacks. If the default java command points to Java 8, you're fine. If not, specify the Java 8 command location here.
		F) Change the "-Xmx2G" to at **LEAST "-Xmx6G" FOR ALL MODPACKS.** You can go higher if you have the RAM to spare.
