### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* [FoalFreePress](https://github.com//FoalFreePress/) is the main organization I have for most of my non-fork repositories.
* [azure-shonx](https://github.com/azure-shonx) is my organization that houses my repositories for various Azure projects. Admittedly, they are bare-bones, but they do work!
* [PonyvilleSquare](https://github.com/PonyvilleSquare) is the legacy organization for lots of old coding projects that are no longer updated.
* [MCProfiler](https://github.com/FoalFreePress/MCProfiler) is a Bukkit plugin that allows you to track player names. It's one of the better projects I've made.
* [redbot-cogs](https://github.com/FoalFreePress/redbot-cogs) is my repository for cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). You should check it out sometime.
* [SimpleBackpacks](https://github.com/FoalFreePress/SimpleBackpacks) is a Forge mod that implements Simple Backpacks into the game. Inspired by [IronBackpacks](https://github.com/gr8pefish/IronBackpacks).
